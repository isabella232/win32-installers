General Information
===================

This package provides merge modules and installers for Gtk# on Windows.
Runtime installers provide the GTK+ base, and will install Gtk# into the
Microsoft .NET GAC.  SDK installers provide the Runtime sources, development
files (like headers and pc files) for GTK+ and also integrate loosely with
Visual Studio 2003 and Visual Studio 2005.

Requirements
============

 * Wix 3.0.3725.0 or greater installed, and the location of the "bin" folder in 
   your PATH.

Building Installers
=====================
To build an installer for a gtk-sharp version, first build the desired 
gtk-sharp tarball using:

./configure
make win32-installer

Copy the resulting .msm files from the gtk-sharp directory into the
toplevel directory of this module. Then update the following files:

runtime-en/Runtime.wxs
sdk-en/SDK.wxs

to reflect the version of gtk-sharp you are building.  Then make in the
toplevel directory of this module to build the necessary gtk+, glade, and
dependency msm modules and the runtime and sdk msi installers.

The two installers will reside in runtime-en and sdk-en when the build
succeeds.


Building Merge Modules
======================

To build individual merge modules, open the Command Line (Start -> Run ->
"cmd") and change directory into the module you want to build.  Run "make" to
build the module.

Individual merge modules can be merged into other MSI-based installers to
provide Gtk+ and friends.  One huge caveat though, if a user tries to install
more than one installer that provide different GTK+ versions and set the PATH
enviroment variable, the installed Gtk+ versions will likely conflict in
unpredicatble ways.  Your mileage may vary.

As a convention, the -dev modules require the -lib modules to be installed and
merged.
